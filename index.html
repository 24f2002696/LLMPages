ashravan.txt:
```
Ashravan blinked, the world resolving from a swirl of colors into the familiar opulence of the Emperor's study. He drew a shaky breath, the sensation of being *wrong* slowly receding. He remembered the chaos, the soulstamp shattering, his own essence unraveling. And then…nothing. Until now.

He looked at his hands, turning them over. They seemed…right. Solid. He felt…whole. He remembered Shai's touch, her words, the overwhelming sense of rightness that had flooded him as she completed the Forgery. But had it worked? Had she truly restored him?

He glanced at the documents strewn across the Emperor's desk. Ordinarily, he'd feel an immediate surge of possessiveness, a need to know every detail of state. Now, he felt…distant. The desire was muted, a faint echo of its former intensity. He reached for a proclamation, outlining a new trade agreement with the Tevian Dominion. Before, he would have instantly critiqued its every clause, identified weaknesses, and formulated strategies. Now, he simply read it. He understood it. He even saw some merit in it.

This… this was disconcerting.

He stepped to the window, looking out at the sprawling city of Elantris. His city. He had shaped it, molded it to his will. But now, he saw the beauty in the gardens, the vibrant colors of the marketplace, the smiles on the faces of the common folk. Things he had never truly *seen* before. He only saw opportunity.

A flicker of fear sparked within him. Was this truly restoration? Or was this…replacement? Had Shai merely crafted a perfect imitation of Ashravan, a puppet devoid of the ambition and ruthlessness that had defined him?

The door burst open, and a Royal Guard, breathless and panicked, rushed in. "Your Majesty! The Shu-Dereth… they’ve broken through the outer defenses! They're attacking the palace!"

Ashravan felt a familiar surge of adrenaline, the thrill of battle coursing through his veins. But this time, it wasn't fueled by a desire for power, for conquest. It was driven by a primal need to protect his people.

"Sound the alarm!" he roared, his voice regaining its former authority. "Assemble the Guard! Prepare for battle!"

He grabbed his sword, the weight familiar in his hand. As he charged out of the study, toward the chaos and the coming storm, a chilling thought struck him. He wasn't afraid of dying. He was afraid of losing what he had just begun to see. He was afraid of losing the man he was finally becoming.
