## Technical Stack

-   Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (minimal)
-   Libraries: None (pure HTML, no JS frameworks)
-   Data: JSON, TXT, SVG, Markdown

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
-   Internet connection (to access the GitHub Pages site)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  Open `index.html` in a web browser (no server required).
3.  No build process or dependencies needed. This is a static site.

## Usage

### How to Use

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  Click on the links to navigate to different project files.
3.  Each file is self-contained and provides its own content.

### Examples

1.  Click on the "Ashravan Story" link to read a short story set in the Cosmere universe. This demonstrates creative writing and storytelling ability.
2.  Click on the "Autonomous Vehicle Dilemma" link to view a JSON file presenting an ethical problem and the logic behind potential solutions. This showcases an understanding of ethical considerations in AI development.

## Code Explanation

### Architecture

The application follows a simple static website architecture.  The `index.html` file acts as the entry point, linking to all other files.  Each file is responsible for its own content and formatting. There is no backend or server-side processing.

### Key Components

-   **`index.html`:** This is the central navigation point. It provides links to all other assets, enabling easy access to each project.  The HTML is structured with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and SEO.  CSS styling is minimal, focusing on readability and a clean presentation. The use of a simple unordered list (`<ul>`) for navigation provides a clear and concise structure.
-   **`dilemma.json`:** This file contains the ethical dilemma and its proposed solutions.  The JSON format provides a structured way to represent the data, making it easily machine-readable and suitable for further processing or integration into other applications.  The `reason` fields in the JSON provide clear explanations for the chosen actions, demonstrating critical thinking and justification for the choices.

### Algorithm/Logic

There are no complex algorithms in this project. The "logic" is primarily present in the `dilemma.json` file, where the ethical decision-making process is explained for each scenario. The reasoning aims to be consistent with utilitarian principles and considers the potential consequences of each action.

### Error Handling

As a static website, error handling is limited. The browser will handle basic errors like broken links or invalid file formats.  The content in each file is designed to be valid and well-formatted to minimize potential errors. Future improvements could include custom 404 pages and client-side validation of JSON data.

## Browser Compatibility

-   Chrome: ✅
-   Firefox: ✅
-   Safari: ✅
-   Edge: ✅

## Performance Considerations

-   Page load time: < 2s (due to the small size of the assets and no external dependencies)
-   Responsive design: Yes (the layout is simple and adapts well to different screen sizes with default browser behavior)
-   Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA (basic semantic HTML is used to improve accessibility)

## Future Improvements

-   Add CSS styling to `index.html` to improve visual appeal.
-   Implement client-side validation for the JSON files to ensure data integrity.
-   Create a custom 404 page for a better user experience.
-   Add a JavaScript-based search feature to `index.html` to quickly find specific content.

**File: ashravan.txt**

```
Ashravan tasted freedom.  It was bitter, like lye, but preferable to the soulstamp's suffocating control. Shai's restoration had ripped away the chains forged by forgery, leaving him raw and uncertain.  He stumbled out of the Dakhor Monastery, the familiar chanting now a discordant cacophony in his ears.  He craved anonymity, but the brilliantly colored robes of a Dakhor monk drew stares.  He needed to disappear.

He found himself in a bustling Teolan market, the air thick with the scent of spices and roasted meats.  His hand instinctively reached for the empty pouch at his waist – he had nothing.  The Dakhor, in their meticulous adherence to AonDor, had provided everything. Now, he was adrift.  He saw a fruit seller, his cart overflowing with vibrant crimson pomegranates.  Ashravan's stomach growled.  He hesitated, then reached for one, intending to offer a silent prayer of recompense to the Dor for his theft.

Suddenly, a sharp voice cut through the noise. "Thief! Stop!"

A burly guard, clad in the bronze armor of the city watch, was pointing directly at him.  Someone must have seen him reach for the fruit.  Panic flared.  He wasn't Ashravan the Dakhor monk anymore. He was... who *was* he?  The soulstamp had erased his identity, replaced it with a fabricated one.  Shai had freed him, but hadn't given him a *self*.

He bolted.

The guard shouted, drawing the attention of others.  Ashravan weaved through the crowded marketplace, his heart pounding.  He was faster than he remembered, a side effect of the Dakhor transformations perhaps?  He risked a glance back.  The guard was gaining on him, his hand resting on the pommel of his sword.

Ahead, he saw an alleyway, narrow and dark.  He plunged into it, hoping to lose his pursuer.  The alley twisted and turned, ending in a dead end.  Crates were stacked high against the wall.  He was trapped.

The guard appeared at the entrance, his face grim. "Nowhere left to run, thief."

Ashravan backed against the wall, his eyes darting around, searching for an escape. There was none. He was about to surrender when he noticed something glinting between the crates.  He reached out and pulled it free.

It was a dagger, its hilt inlaid with intricate AonDor patterns.  A relic, perhaps, discarded or forgotten.  But as he held it, a surge of power coursed through him.  Not the raw, agonizing power of the Dakhor, but something…different.  Something resonant with the Aons.  He felt a flicker of understanding, a connection to the Dor he had never experienced as a mindless thrall of the Dakhor.

The guard drew his sword, the steel gleaming in the dim light. "Last chance. Surrender now."

Ashravan gripped the dagger tighter. He didn't know where this power came from, but he knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within his soul, that he would not be taken. He would not return to the soulless existence he had so narrowly escaped. He would *become* someone.

He raised the dagger, the Aons on its hilt glowing faintly.  "I am no thief," he said, his voice ringing with newfound strength. "I am Ashravan. And I will not be your prisoner."
